# Overview 

This is a super simple middleware integrating with [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin) to implement RBAC in Gin apps.

# Installation

```shell
$ go get github.com/xskit/gin-casbin
```

# Usage

See [examples](https://github.com/xskit/gin-casbin/tree/master/examples).

## SubjectFn

You will have to provide a custom function to look up the current subject in runtime when you initialize this middleware.

```go
// SubjectFn is used to look up current subject in runtime.
// If it can not find anything, just return an empty string.
type SubjectFn func(c *gin.Context) string
```

I am pretty sure there are many ways to do this. I provided two examples using JWT and session respectively.

## RequiresPermissions

This is one of the two core functionalities. You can use it to filter requests if the subjects don't have the required permissions.

```go
func (am *CasbinMiddleware) RequiresPermissions(permissions []string, opts ...Option) gin.HandlerFunc
``` 

The first parameter is a slice of formatted strings representing required permissions. For example, `"book:read"` stands for the permission to read a book. Note that if you pass in an illegal string such as `"bookread"` or `":"`, it will abort immediately and respond HTTP 500.

## RequiresRoles

This is the other core functionality. It is a little simpler than `RequiresPermissions` since you just need to specify what roles you expect the subjects to have.

```go
func (am *CasbinMiddleware) RequiresRoles(requiredRoles []string, opts ...Option) gin.HandlerFunc
```
